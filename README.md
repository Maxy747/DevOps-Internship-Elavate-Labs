DevOps Internship - Elavate Labs - Tasks

This repository contains all the completed tasks for the **DevOps Internship** program at **Elavate Labs**. It serves as a comprehensive portfolio demonstrating practical skills in various essential DevOps domains, focusing on establishing robust and automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

## üéØ Project Goal

The primary goal of this internship was to implement, automate, and manage infrastructure and application deployment using modern DevOps tools and practices. The 8 distinct tasks represent a structured journey from foundational scripting and infrastructure provisioning to complex application containerization, pipeline creation, and deployment.

## üìÇ Repository Structure & Tasks

The repository is organized into 8 individual folders, each corresponding to a major task completed during the internship.

| Folder | Core Focus | Inferred Description (Customize This!) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Task 1](Task 1)** | **Linux & Scripting Fundamentals** | Automating routine administrative tasks using **Bash** or **Python** scripting to manage system resources and logs. |
| **[Task 2](Task 2)** | **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) - Provisioning** | Defining and provisioning cloud resources (e.g., a VPC, EC2 instance, or S3 bucket) using **HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) / Terraform**. |
| **[Task 3](Task 3)** | **Containerization with Docker** | Creating efficient, multi-stage **Dockerfiles** for the sample Java/Python/Node.js application and managing images locally. |
| **[Task 4](Task 4)** | **Source Control & Collaboration** | Demonstrating advanced **Git** workflows (branching, merging strategies, rebasing) and integration with version control (GitHub). |
| **[Task 5](Task 5)** | **Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline** | Implementing an automated CI pipeline (using **GitHub Actions**) to build the application, run unit tests, and push the resulting Docker image to a registry. |
| **[Task 6](Task 6)** | **Continuous Deployment (CD) Setup** | Extending the CI pipeline to a full CD process, automatically deploying the containerized application to a staging environment (e.g., a single EC2 or a basic Kubernetes deployment). |
| **[Task 7](Task 7)** | **Application Orchestration (Kubernetes)** | Defining and deploying the application using **Kubernetes Manifests** (Deployments, Services, Ingress) for high availability. |
| **[Task 8](Task 8)** | **Monitoring, Logging, and Observability** | Implementing a solution for centralized logging (e.g., **ELK Stack** or **Prometheus/Grafana**) for the deployed application. |
