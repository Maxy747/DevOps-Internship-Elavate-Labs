# 1. Start from an official Python base image
# Using "slim" is a good practice for smaller image sizes
FROM python:3.10-slim

# 2. Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# 3. Copy the requirements file first and install dependencies
# This is a key optimization. As long as requirements.txt doesn't change,
# Docker will use a cached layer, making future builds much faster.
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# 4. Copy the rest of the application code into the container
COPY . .

# 5. Expose port 5000 (the port Flask will run on)
EXPOSE 5000

# 6. Define the command to run when the container starts
# We use flask run --host=0.0.0.0 to make it accessible
CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
